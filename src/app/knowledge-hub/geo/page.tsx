      question: "What is the difference between Local SEO and GEO for local businesses?",
      answer: "Local SEO focuses on improving visibility within established Google Search and Map interfaces through relevance, prominence, reviews, and proximity signals. GEO shapes how AI models learn about, synthesise, and recommend your brand across conversational interfaces, AI Overviews, and multi-brand roundups."
    },
    {
      question: "How does traditional geolocation SEO differ from Generative Engine Optimisation?",
      answer: "Traditional geolocation SEO focuses on optimising physical rank signals (IP address, localised keywords, Google Maps pins) to rank on static 10-blue-link or map pack SERPs. GEO ensures AI systems accurately retrieve, parse, and cite your local service boundaries during multi-constraint conversational queries."
    },
    {
      question: "How do GEO and Local SEO work together to capture local market share?",
      answer: "Local SEO drives organic map pack placements and local search rankings, while GEO reduces ambiguity around business facts and builds the citation footprint required for AI recommendation engines. Together, they align proximity signals with cross-source factual reconciliation."
    },
    {
      question: "Are GeoCoordinates and areaServed schema mandatory for AI search indexing?",
      answer: "No. No schema markup is strictly mandatory for AI search indexing or guarantees inclusion in generative answers. However, deploying GeoCoordinates and areaServed JSON-LD microdata provides a machine-readable data layer that clarifies your physical location and coverage boundaries when search systems reconcile local entities."
    },
    {
      question: "How should local businesses handle location pages without creating thin duplicate content?",
      answer: "Avoid creating templated suburb pages that lack distinct substance. Publish location-specific landing pages only where you have genuine local value, original evidence, unique customer proofs, and distinct service context. Quality location pages with authentic regional proof support local discovery without risking thin-content penalties."

                For years, &quot;geolocation SEO&quot; and &quot;geo-targeting&quot; meant adding suburb keywords to title tags and setting up radius targeting in ad platforms. In Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO), <strong>Local GEO</strong> is fundamentally different: it is the process of structuring your business entity—address, service areas, credentials, and real-world proof—so that generative AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and AI Overviews) can verify, cite, and recommend you in conversational local queries.
