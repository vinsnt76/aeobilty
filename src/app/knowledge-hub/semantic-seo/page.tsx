                  Search engines no longer rely on exact keyword matches. They interpret your site as a set of connected entities and the relationships between them. When these relationships are clear, AI systems can understand your business, classify your services, and recommend you confidently across <Link href="/knowledge-hub/geo" className="text-aeo-cyan hover:underline font-semibold">Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO)</Link> channels.

                    Modern search engines do not &ldquo;see&rdquo; words: they see <strong>math</strong>. Every entity, sentence, and concept is converted into a high‑dimensional vector. The closer two vectors sit together, the more related they are.

                  <p className="text-xs text-white/70 font-light leading-relaxed">
                    This lets AI recognise meaning even when a keyword is not used. If your page talks about &ldquo;Primaris Marines,&rdquo; &ldquo;Citadel paints,&rdquo; and &ldquo;edge highlighting,&rdquo; the model understands you are talking about <strong>Space Marines</strong> because those concepts consistently appear together across the web.

                <p>
                  Traditional SEO agencies focus heavily on keywords, but AI search models look for contextual entity salience. When Google or OpenAI indexes site data, it builds a complex knowledge graph path connecting your business nodes to specific categories.

                <h4 className="text-xs font-bold text-aeo-cyan uppercase font-mono">2. Why It Matters</h4>
                <p>
                  By structuring page data into high-density content lattices using explicit RDF predicate mapping rules, you tell LLMs exactly who you serve and where, allowing them to categorise your brand confidently.

                <p>
                  Transition away from thin keyword pages toward interconnected topic hubs. Ensure every service page defines clear subjects, predicates, and objects.
