              Cosine similarity computes the dot product of two normalized 768-dimensional vectors divided by their magnitudes. Because it measures the angle between vectors rather than their spatial distance, it evaluates pure semantic direction—ensuring content length variations do not distort relevance measurement against competitors.

              When evaluating competitor overlap, AEObility distinguishes between <strong>Semantic Overlap</strong> (topic similarity) and <strong>Feature Overlap</strong> (structural capabilities). High semantic overlap without structured microdata causes content dilution, where AI models view your page as a generic duplicate.
