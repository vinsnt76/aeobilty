      question: "What are the top indicators or red flags that a business needs GEO help instead of just SEO?",
      answer: "The primary red flag is a divergence between search rankings and AI citations: your website ranks on page one of Google, but ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google AI Overviews ignore or misquote your business. Other key indicators include declining local map enquiries despite stable keyword ranks, AI engines conflating your brand with competitors, and website copy loaded with abstract marketing terms that vector engines filter out. If search engines index your pages but answer engines fail to cite your facts, your site requires GEO entity restructuring."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do GEO myself or do I need to hire someone, and what does a good GEO engagement actually include?",
      answer: "You can handle foundational GEO tasks yourself if you understand structured Schema.org code, eliminate vague marketing jargon in favour of plain facts, and maintain consistent NAP details across directories. Hire a specialist if your website is full of buzzwords that AI tools ignore or if you lack the technical background to build clean code graphs and verify how answer engines read your pages. A solid GEO engagement delivers clean structured code, direct answer blocks, consistent directory data, logical internal links, and thorough validation with 100% client IP ownership."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I evaluate a GEO agency?",
      answer: "Evaluate prospective agencies based on technical proofs and transparent delivery models. Check if the agency scores highly on objective benchmarks like isitagentready.com and provides machine-readable schema on their own site. Avoid long-term retainers with vague deliverables, and beware of guarantees regarding ChatGPT rankings. Choose partners providing fixed-scope sprints, transparent audit baselines, and complete code handovers."

            Traditional SEO focuses on getting web pages indexed and ranked for keyword strings. Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO) focuses on making your brand’s core facts understandable, verifiable, and citeable by AI answer engines like ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-300 font-serif leading-relaxed">
            If your digital marketing metrics show strong traditional search performance but declining conversion momentum, your website is likely encountering an AI retrieval gap. Recognising when your business needs Generative Engine Optimisation instead of legacy SEO comes down to one clear shift: traditional SEO fights for blue-link clicks, while GEO ensures your business gets cited, recommended, and chosen inside AI answer engines. If search engines and AI models cannot verify your business facts, they guess. When they guess, you lose qualified leads.
