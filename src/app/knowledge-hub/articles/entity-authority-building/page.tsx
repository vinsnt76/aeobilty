              Entity authority building is how your business becomes consistently recognisable, trustworthy and machine understandable across the web. When AI systems know who you are, what you do and who you serve, they can confidently recommend you.

              Entity authority shifts attention from ranking URLs to recognising the organisation behind them. It relies on machine recognition, which is how clearly AI systems understand who you are and what you do. It also relies on compounded trust, which grows when your facts, brand details and data stay consistent across the web.
