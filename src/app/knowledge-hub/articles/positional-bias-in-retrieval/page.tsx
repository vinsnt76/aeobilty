When key credentials sit in the middle of long pages, neural retrievers and LLMs exhibit primacy and recency preference, causing hidden content to suffer from attention dilution.

              <p className="text-sm text-white/80 font-light leading-relaxed font-serif">
                Dense vector models and late interaction models can be sensitive to where a fact sits inside a passage. Research indicates that these models often perform better when relevant information appears near the beginning of a text block rather than later. One explanation is that vector search models map text to high dimensional coordinates. When key facts are buried deep inside a passage, the opening sentences influence the embedding and the passage can appear less relevant.

              <div className="p-4 bg-white/5 border border-white/5 rounded-xl text-xs text-white/70 leading-relaxed font-serif">
                <strong>Model Dynamics:</strong> Keyword matching models like BM25 and full interaction rerankers tend to be more robust to this variation, but modern answer engines often rely heavily on neural retrievers. That is why your most important information should sit near the top of each section where retrievers are most likely to recognise it.

                The <strong>lost in the middle</strong> effect can impair an LLM’s ability to find, verify and use facts from its context window. Even with large context windows, attention is not uniform. Experiments show a distinctive U-shaped pattern where models perform best when relevant information is at the beginning or end of a sequence and less well when it sits in the middle.

                  Positional bias is the tendency for retrieval and answer engines to favour information at the beginning or end of a passage, reducing the reliability of middle-placed content.
