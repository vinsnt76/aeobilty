              Structured data provides explicit machine-readable entity context when search systems expand complex user queries into multiple sub-intents.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg font-light text-white/90 font-serif leading-relaxed">
              AI search engines no longer evaluate a single keyword or phrase in isolation. When a user asks a complex question, modern systems break that prompt into multiple sub-queries, a process known as query fan-out. Structured data and atomic answer blocks give these systems the scaffolding they need to correctly interpret your entity across all sub-intents.

              Structured data can provide explicit context about entities, products, organisations, and relationships. This may help search systems interpret a page, but it does not guarantee retrieval, rankings, AI citations, or inclusion in an AI-generated answer. Its value is strongest when the markup accurately reflects visible, useful content and is supported by sound technical SEO, authoritative content, local signals, and consistent business information.

                Google officially describes query fan-out as concurrent, related queries generated to retrieve additional information for a user&apos;s query. Some AI search systems may expand a user&apos;s question into multiple related searches or retrieval tasks. The number and nature of those searches vary, so fan-out should be treated as a system behaviour rather than a fixed sequence of checks.

              <p>
                When a user asks a multi-faceted question, search engines do not rely solely on a single keyword lookup. Instead, the retrieval pipeline may decompose the prompt into several targeted sub-queries covering specific subtopics, such as pricing, local service availability, materials, or compliance credentials.

                <p>
                  Query fan-out can produce multiple retrieval paths for the same underlying entity. A stable identifier can help an indexing or retrieval system recognise that separate passages refer to the same organisation, product, service, or topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, a passage about an organisation&apos;s AEO services might be indexed with:
                </p>

                <div className="p-4 bg-neutral-950 border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-xs space-y-1.5 text-aeo-cyan/90">
                  <div><span className="text-white/50">Entity ID:   </span>https://example.com/#organisation</div>
                  <div><span className="text-white/50">Page ID:     </span>https://example.com/services/aeo</div>
                  <div><span className="text-white/50">Passage ID:  </span>https://example.com/services/aeo#passage-local-seo</div>
                </div>

                <p>
                  These identifiers can support entity-aware chunking, deduplication, graph expansion, and citation provenance. If several passages refer to the same entity, the retrieval system can preserve that relationship rather than treating every passage as an isolated text fragment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is an architectural benefit rather than a guaranteed search-ranking signal. A stable <code className="text-aeo-cyan font-mono text-xs">@id</code> does not automatically increase vector similarity, make a passage easier for Google to retrieve, or guarantee an AI citation. Its value depends on whether the indexing or retrieval system actually ingests and uses the identifiers.
