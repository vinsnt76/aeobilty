      question: "What does AEO mean in digital marketing?",
      answer: "Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO) is the practice of making business information easy for AI-powered search and answer systems to find, interpret, and use. It combines clear, evidence-backed content, well-defined entities, structured data, accessible technical implementation, and logical internal linking."
    },
    {
      question: "How is AEO different from SEO?",
      answer: "Traditional SEO focuses on organic discoverability, technical foundations, and ranking pages across search engine results pages (SERPs). AEO builds upon these SEO foundations by structuring content into concise answer-ready passages and explicit schema, improving how business information is retrieved and represented in AI-mediated answers."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does AEO matter for businesses today?",
      answer: "Consumers increasingly ask conversational questions across AI search interfaces, AI Overviews, maps, and virtual assistants. Structuring information clearly helps ensure that AI systems accurately understand your services, reducing ambiguity and improving eligibility for citations where engines cite web sources."
    },
    {
      question: "How do modern AI systems retrieve and process content?",
      answer: "AI search platforms deploy varied architectures. They may retrieve and synthesise passages, full pages, structured data, and trusted third-party sources using vector embeddings, semantic matching, and traditional lexical retrieval pipelines."
    },
    {
      question: "What is semantic chunking?",
      answer: "Semantic chunking is the practice of structuring text into self-contained units of meaning that convey complete facts, qualifications, and evidence together. Keeping factual context intact reduces ambiguity during machine retrieval."
    },
    {
      question: "What are embeddings and why are they important?",
      answer: "Embeddings are mathematical vector representations of language meaning. They allow search and AI systems to evaluate conceptual relationships alongside keyword matches, helping content surface when user phrasing varies."
    },
    {
      question: "Does structured data guarantee AI citations or rankings?",
      answer: "No. Structured data makes entity relationships more explicit for systems that support it. It improves interpretability and eligibility, but no provider can guarantee inclusion, rich results, or direct recommendations."
    },
    {
      question: "Is AEO relevant for Australian small businesses?",
      answer: "Yes. Clear entity metadata, verified business credentials, and structured service-area details help local search engines and AI assistants accurately interpret regional relevance for queries across Perth and Australia."
    },
    {
      question: "Where should a business start with AEO?",
      answer: "Start with a technical baseline audit to assess how search engines and AI systems interpret your current web footprint. Then structure priority service content into self-contained answer blocks, implement explicit Schema.org markup, and establish descriptive internal links."
