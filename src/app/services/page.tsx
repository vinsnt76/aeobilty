                      Yes. AEO, AI Search Strategy and GEO Marketing reinforce each other. When your business is clear to AI systems, your Google Maps and Apple Maps signals strengthen. When your local entity signals improve, LLMs gain confidence recommending you for local queries. This combined approach is why AEObility’s Perth, Australia clients see higher visibility across Search, Maps and AI.
